Firstly, I would like to thank the AI for rendering a Death Star to describe this blog ;). Hopefully the obedience and accuracy of generative content can improve along with my own writing and technical knowledge as this blog evolves.

## About Me

As a "_jack of many trades_" in an IT context, I find the most impactful roles are cross-functional and able to make use of my 24 years experience across IT Operations, Security, Architecture and Software Development roles to understand a context and ensure innovation comes at pace with high chances of success.

## Motivation

The idea of hosting my own blog on technical topics has been going through my head using the very Kiwi "_Yeah, Nah_" process for a while.

-   Do I have time for that?
-   Will others be interested in what I have to say?

Ultimately, I need my own place to review what I have previously discovered in any case and in a world of faster and faster evolution of digital technologies with the advent of the public and commercial Internet, open and crowd-sourcing and cloud computing over the span of my career sharing learnings and discoveries in a concise and practical way cannot be more important.
