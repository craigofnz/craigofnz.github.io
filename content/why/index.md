## Why

The idea of hosting my own blog on technical topics has been going through my head using the very Kiwi "_Yeah, Nah_" process for a while.

-   Do I have time for that?
-   Will others be interested in what I have to say?

Ultimately, I need my own place to review what I have previously discovered in any case and in a world of faster and faster evolution of digital technologies with the advent of the public and commercial Internet, open and crowd-sourcing and cloud computing over the span of my career sharing learnings and discoveries in a concise and practical way cannot be more important.
